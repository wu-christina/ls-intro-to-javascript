# Launch School: Introduction to Programming with JavaScript

Part of Launch School's JS100 prep course, these are my solutions to the exercises in the [Introduction to Programming with JavaScript](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript) book.

### Repository Organization Method
* Use one git repository for all exercises in the JavaScript book.
* Create a folder within that repository for each chapter in the book.
* Create a separate file for every exercise in the chapter.
